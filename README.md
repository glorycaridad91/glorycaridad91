- 👋 Hi, I’m @Gloria
- 👀 I’m interested in developing applications with the Java Language, using frameworks such as Spring boot or Quarkus.
- 🌱 I have acquired knowledge with several tools like Maven, Git Bash, Bitbucket, AWS, Docker, Liquibase, SQL, Relational databases, Angular, and others.
- 💞️ Working with Java language is my passion, so my main career goal is to work as a Java developer where I can apply my knowledge and continue to grow professionally. I also aspire to become a leader in the future.
- 💥 I’m looking to collaborate with international companies, working in a highly collaborative environment with cross-functional teams.
- 📫 Can reach me to the email: glorycaridad91@gmail.com
